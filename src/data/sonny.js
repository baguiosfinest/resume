  "profile": "I have more than 8 years experience working in the IT industry. Worked as html coder, frontend, wordpress and web developer for different clients from US, Canada, UK, New Zealand and Australia. My ability to remain calm and professional during tight deadlines makes me capable of working under pressure and can multitask at the same time. I am a determined and enthusiastic individual, willing to learn, be trained and can work on minimal supervision. With my past experiences I can say that I can produce ‘pixel perfect’ outputs, can combine quality and speed and lastly I rather start working than talking about it.",
